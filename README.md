# Item Analysis Application

This project is an __item analysis application__ designed to perform statistical analysis of exam results. It computes key metrics such as the difficulty index and discrimination index for each question.
⚠️ **Note:** This project is still under development, and additional features and improvements are planned.

## Current Features
* Statistical analysis of exam results, including:
	* Mean, median, and mode
	* Minimum and maximum scores
	* Score distribution visualization (Histogram)
* Calculation of:
	* Difficulty index
    * Discrimination index
* Supports exams where each question is graded as 0 or 1

## Releases
The repository includes a **release folder** containing adjusted code for building a binary executable. This build allows the application to be distributed without requiring a Python environment on the target machine.

## To Do / Future Work
* Support exams with **continuous/fractional marks**
	* Currently, the analysis only works for exams where each question has binary grading (0 or 1)
